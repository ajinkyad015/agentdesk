You're at the point where the **foundation is complete**. The next phase is turning the foundation into a working AI application.

I recommend this order because each step builds directly on the previous one without requiring refactoring.

# Phase 2: API Layer

## 1. Pydantic Schemas (Next)

Create a dedicated `schemas/` package.

```text
app/
└── schemas/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── common.py
    ├── user.py
    ├── conversation.py
    ├── message.py
    ├── chat.py
    └── task.py
```

Examples:

```python
ConversationCreate
ConversationResponse

MessageCreate
MessageResponse

ChatRequest
ChatResponse

TaskResponse
```

These become the contracts between frontend and backend.

---

## 2. Dependency Injection

```text
app/
└── api/
    └── deps.py
```

Contains:

* Database dependency
* Current user dependency
* Service factories
* Authentication helpers

Example:

```python
async def get_conversation_service(
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
):
    return ConversationService(db)
```

---

## 3. Authentication

```text
app/
├── auth/
│   ├── jwt.py
│   ├── password.py
│   ├── dependencies.py
│   └── service.py
```

Implement:

* JWT
* Password hashing
* Login
* Register
* Refresh tokens
* Protected endpoints

---

# Phase 3: REST API

## Conversations

```
POST   /conversations

GET    /conversations

GET    /conversations/{id}

DELETE /conversations/{id}
```

---

## Chat

```
POST /chat
```

Request

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "...",
  "message": "Explain FastAPI"
}
```

Response

```json
{
  "reply": "...",
  "tokens": ...
}
```

---

## Tasks

```
GET /tasks

POST /tasks

DELETE /tasks/{id}
```

---

# Phase 4: Modern OpenAI Integration

The current `LLMService` uses **Chat Completions**.

I recommend replacing it with the **Responses API**.

Advantages:

* Better tool calling
* Reasoning models
* Built-in conversation support
* Future-proof
* Streaming improvements

This will require redesigning:

```
OpenAIProvider

↓

ResponsesProvider
```

---

# Phase 5: Tool Calling

Create

```text
app/
└── tools/
    ├── base.py
    ├── registry.py
    ├── executor.py
    ├── calculator.py
    ├── weather.py
    └── ...
```

Agent flow becomes

```
User

↓

LLM

↓

Tool Calls?

↓

Execute Tool

↓

Append Tool Result

↓

LLM

↓

Assistant
```

---

# Phase 6: Streaming

Instead of waiting:

```
User

↓

(wait)

↓

Entire answer
```

Use Server-Sent Events:

```
User

↓

Token

↓

Token

↓

Token

↓

Done
```

Endpoint

```
POST /chat/stream
```

---

# Phase 7: Background Tasks

```
Task Queue

↓

Agent

↓

Progress

↓

Completed
```

Useful for

* Research
* Long tool chains
* Document processing
* Large prompts

---

# Phase 8: Testing

```
tests/

test_models.py

test_repositories.py

test_services.py

test_chat.py

test_auth.py
```

Use

* pytest
* pytest-asyncio
* httpx
* Testcontainers (recommended)

---

# Phase 9: Docker

```
Dockerfile

docker-compose.yml

postgres

redis

backend
```

---

# Phase 10: Production

Add

* Health checks
* Metrics
* OpenTelemetry tracing
* Structured logging
* Rate limiting
* Caching
* Secrets management
* CI/CD
* Deployment

---

# Recommended Final Structure

```text
app/
├── api/
├── auth/
├── core/
├── db/
├── middleware/
├── models/
├── repositories/
├── schemas/
├── services/

└── utils/
```

# Recommended Next Coding Task

The next implementation should be the **Pydantic schemas**.

This unlocks everything else because the API layer depends on them. The recommended order is:

1. `app/schemas/common.py`
2. `app/schemas/conversation.py`
3. `app/schemas/message.py`
4. `app/schemas/chat.py`
5. `app/schemas/task.py`
6. `app/api/deps.py`
7. Conversation endpoints
8. Chat endpoints
9. Authentication
10. Replace the current LLM implementation with the OpenAI Responses API
11. Tool calling and streaming

This path minimizes rework and results in a production-ready AI backend.
